<h2>
What Is
<span itemprop='name'>Accounts Receivable Factoring</span>?
</h2>
<p>
<span itemprop='description'>Receivable factoring is a commonly used form of funding where a business sells its outstanding receivables to a factoring company to obtain immediate working capital.</span>
</p>
<p class='highlighted'>
Regardless of your current financial condition, personal credit history, or time in business, you can quickly and easily access your money/funds tied up in unpaid invoices within 24 hours without the usual red tape associated with bank financing.
<a href='/'>Factoring companies</a>
give a growing business tremendous advantages over traditional bank loans, private investors or friends and family.
</p>
<p>When you are factoring receivables, you are basically  getting cash advances against the face values of your outstanding invoices. The  only deduction that comes out of your money is the fee charged by the factoring company. The rest of the money is deposited directly into your bank account,  and much of it is deposited within a few hours of approving the invoice.</p>
<p><strong>The great thing about receivable factoring is that there is no need for you to  have great credit</strong>. The really important decisions in an accounts receivable factoring transaction are based on the credit strength of your client base. No  matter how bad things seem to be going for your company, as long as you have  outstanding receivables with creditworthy clients, then you have the cash flow  you need to do business.</p>
<h3>Now let's look at the situations where you would need a receivable factoring  company.</h3>
<p>
<strong>A Start-Up With Weak Cash Flow</strong>
</p>
<p>When an entrepreneur decides to make the big move and start a company, they  will usually secure enough funds for the first six months of operations. After  that start-up money runs out, there better be cash flow from customers paying  their bills or else the new company is in trouble. More often than not, the new  company runs the risk of going out of business.</p>
<p>A bank won't help in this situation because of the start-ups inconsequential  credit history. Instead of worrying about how you will keep your start-up  afloat, you just need to gather up your outstanding receivables and give our factoring company a call.</p>
<p>
<strong>Companies With Bad Credit</strong>
</p>
<p>In the business world, bad credit is like a snowball rolling down a snowy  mountainside. By the time it reaches the bottom, it is an unstoppable boulder  of ice and snow. When your company has bad credit, the banks are usually  unwilling to lend you the money you need to keep going. That is when you get  involved in invoice factoring and let your outstanding receivables pave the way  to success.</p>
<p>
<strong>Growth Is Outpacing Cash Flow</strong>
</p>
<p>Your company has toiled for years and now you are finally seeing significant  financial growth. Things are so great that the orders you are getting are  outpacing the money that is coming in. A bank can make this a big problem by  refusing to lend you money due to your tenuous cash position. But a receivable factoring company will get you the cash you need and help to keep that cash  rolling in, just as long as you have outstanding invoices being generated.</p>
<p>
<strong>Companies That Are Just Recovering From Financial Issues</strong>
</p>
<p>If your company has just come out of bankruptcy or has tax liens hanging over  like a storm cloud, then it will be impossible to get operating cash from a  bank. But a factoring company can take your invoiced sales and help your  company to get back on its feet.</p>
<p>A receivable factoring company is the kind of financial partner you need when  it feels like you have no other options. Remember that to a factoring company,  the strength of your organization is in the invoiced sales that you have worked  so hard to generate.</p>
