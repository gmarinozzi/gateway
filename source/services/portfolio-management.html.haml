          %h3 Specialty servicing branch for the asset-based lending, banking and factoring markets
        %p When you’re in the business of lending, relationships are  everything. As hard as it may be to secure a new relationship, it can sometimes  be even harder to retain one. Sometimes a longtime and loyal client just  doesn’t fit your lending profile. Or a prospect may be attractive in the  long-term, but doesn’t meet your lending standards today.
        %p Telling a prospect or client that they don’t qualify for a  loan is a shared dilemma. They can’t get the cash flow support they need. And  you are unable to assist them and ultimately grow the relationship.
        %p.highlighted It doesn’t have to be this way. Whether you’re an  asset-based lender, a factor, or even an entrepreneurial bank, you can add a suite  of funding options that allow you to help clients who may not be right for your  traditional products. And you don’t even need to invest in employees or  infrastructure to do it.
