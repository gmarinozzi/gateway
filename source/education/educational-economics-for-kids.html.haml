          %h1 Educational Economics for Kids
        %p Knowing how to manage money is a skill that people need at any age. Even young people need to develop strong finance skills so they know how to budget their money and make it stretch across all their needs and wants. If you get an allowance every week, you should think about saving a part of it instead of spending it all when you get it. When you get old enough to earn your own money, you will have even more decisions to make about how you budget, save, and spend your cash. Learning about money may be important, but you can still have fun learning these life lessons. Play games, do puzzles, and watch videos that will teach you all the important facts about finance.
