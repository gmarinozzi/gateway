          %h3 Cash Flow Darkness
          %p
            When David Becker needed additional working capital to support his growing electrical fixture supply company, he turned to Gateway Commercial Finance for a fast solution. "I started this business after nearly 15 years working for a larger distributor that failed when the housing market crashed. I had maintained all of my relationships with customers and our primary suppliers so it was a natural progression that I start my own business. Many of my suppliers offered me limited credit terms to help me out, but as we grew, these credit lines did not support my total sales."

            David's bank had partnered with Gateway Commercial Finance on several occasions and felt this would be an ideal vehicle to support David's growth needs.<strong>"In no time, Gateway had provided us with the additional working capital we needed to support our sales growth it was almost like a flick of a switch!"</strong>

          %h2 Product Supplier Factoring Means Additional Cash to Support Sales Growth
          %p The electrical fixture supply industry moves up and down with the housing market. While there are plenty of opportunities with residential remodeling projects, the real money is in new builds. Then there are the opportunities that come from commercial remodeling and new build projects. When a hotel decides to remodel, there are a lot of lighting fixtures involved in the budget.
          %p A new lighting fixtures company that finds itself in the middle of an economic upswing will see its fortunes change for the better in a hurry. Everyone dreams of success, but that success comes at a price that can become too steep for new suppliers that do not have a comprehensive financial plan.
          %p
            %strong What Do You Do When Your Success Outpaces Your Resources?
          %p A new company usually gets limited credit limits from its suppliers and tends to rely mostly on cash to pay the bills. That is all well and good, until the demands of new customers start to outpace the cash flow. What is a new product supply company supposed to do when the success it has dreamed of starts to slowly bring about its demise? At these moments in a new company's history, it is time to start making financial plans which leverage that success to help pay for the future.
          %h2 Wholesaler Factoring Takes Care Of Overwhelming Financial Needs
