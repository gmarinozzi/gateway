          %h3 Production Dilemma
          %p
            Celtic Engineering is a specialist in oil refinery operations and management. It recently received a multi-year agreement with Chevron to oversee the rehabilitation of a plant in South America. "We've worked with Chevron Global for years and they presented us with a multi-year opportunity to oversee a significant plant renovation in Venezuela. The revenue it's going to spin off will help us grow 100% year over year for the next three years. When we approached our banker about the opportunity, they were eager to support our needs...until they became uncomfortable with the location. We were already deploying engineers and support staff at a tremendous daily cost and had to find a solution, immediately.

We now have the confidence to fully staff the project knowing that we'll have the funds for payroll when needed."</strong>
