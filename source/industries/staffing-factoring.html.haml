Something I can truly appreciate."

              %span{:itemprop => "name"} What is Staffing Factoring?
          %p Temporary staffing companies’ main dilemma is finding ways to cover payroll funding while waiting for clients to pay their invoices. For staffing agencies that typically give their customers 30 to 90-day payment terms payroll funding is frequently a big struggle. Unless the staffing agency is well-established banks won’t usually help with cash flow financing. That’s when staffing factoring usually emerges as the best cash flow financing option.
          %p.highlighted
            %span{:itemprop => "description"} Staffing Factoring is the sale of outstanding staffing invoices by a staffing agency to a financial institution, known as a factor, at a discount.  The factor buys the invoice, advances the staffing company funds, and then waits until the debt is paid.
