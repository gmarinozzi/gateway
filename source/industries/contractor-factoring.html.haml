          %h3 Un-tidy Tax Liabilities
          %p
            Sam Fredrick, owner of Professional Maintenance Care, has a unique and thriving business serving NYC "We're the only contractor in NYC that specializes in trash shoot & garbage room cleaning and maintenance. It's highly specialized and takes a unique skill set." Sam's business experienced double digit growth since inception until 2009, when it experienced its first downturn. "We were growing at a crazy pace, we had 90 employees then everyone started conserving cash and started cutting back where they could… who could blame them!" 
            %br/
            %br/
            Like many businesses, Sam thought the downturn would only be temporary but it lasted more than 18 months. <strong>"We failed to cut staff quick enough and decided that paying certain bills instead of our tax liabilities was the best thing we could do for our people…big mistake."</strong> Professional Maintenance became delinquent on City, State and Federal Taxes and found itself with mounting tax liabilities. "We felt factoring would be a good tool to help us steady out our cash flow and give us an opportunity to work out of the tax situation." Gateway worked diligently with the taxing authorities to arrange the necessary subordination allowing Professional Maintenance to utilize the services of a factor. "Business has picked up and we're on track to achieve operating profitability by year end while making good on our tax liabilities.<strong> Gateway's team worked quickly to clean-up our tax liabilities and speed up our cash flow…something I can really relate to!"</strong>

          %h2 Contractor factoring provides funding to businesses in need
          %p Having a specialty business can be a blessing and a curse, especially when you are in an industry as competitive as maintenance contracting. It is a blessing because, when you become known as being good at something, you can corner a niche and become successful. It can be a curse because contract maintenance is often one of the first things companies re-evaluate during difficult financial times. The specialty businesses are always the first to feel the pinch.

          %p Growing a niche company is difficult at first, but it can become easier as the word starts to circulate about what you do. The tricky part is avoiding taking on too many employees to handle short spikes in business. After a while, those extra employees mean a burden that could become too much for you to handle. If you want to grow your niche company and remain successful, then you are going to need help.
