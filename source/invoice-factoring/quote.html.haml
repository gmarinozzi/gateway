        %h2 About Our Factoring Services
        %p <a href="/services/accounts-receivable-factoring/">Factoring services</a> provide temporary working capital to pre-bankable, non-bankable, rapidly growing and financially troubled businesses.
        %p There many other reasons to choose Gateway as your preferred factoring partner, including:
        %ol
          %li <strong>Cost.</strong> Our  fees are based on the risk associated with the debt we take on. Generally, the  lower the risk of default, the lower your costs will be. Our fees start as low  as 0.5 percent, among the lowest in the factoring industry.
          %li <strong>High advances. </strong>Again,  the amount we advance upfront is often tied to a number of factors, including  the risk of default. We often advance around 80 percent of the invoice amount  and sometimes as much as 95 percent.
          %li <strong>Deal directly  with the decision maker. </strong>There&rsquo;s no jumping through hoops or going through  automated phone systems when you work with Gateway. You have direct contact  with the decision maker on your funding application. We find that connecting  the seller with the decision maker helps us get all the information we need to  make an informed decision. Have extra information about the debt that you think  will help your application? By all means, share it with us.
          %li <strong>Fast funding.</strong> Your first approved request will be funded within three days. All subsequent  requests will be funded within one day. That&rsquo;s among the fastest turnaround  times in the industry. Get the cash you need quickly so you can get back to the  business of running your business.
          %li <strong>High-quality  service.</strong> Our business is built on the quality of our relationships with our  customers. We strive to provide the highest level of service possible. Our job  is to address all of your goals, needs, and concerns so we can all grow  together.
