        %ol
          %li
            %strong Cost.
            Our fees are based on the risk associated with the debt we take on. Generally, the lower the risk of default, the lower your costs will be. Our fees start as low as 0.5 percent, among the lowest in the factoring industry.
          %li
            %strong> High advances.
            Again, the amount we advance upfront is often tied to a number of factors, including the risk of default. We often advance around 80 percent of the invoice amount and sometimes as much as 95 percent.
          %li
            %strong> Deal directly with the decision maker.
            There’s no jumping through hoops or going through automated phone systems when you work with Gateway. You have direct contact with the decision maker on your funding application. We find that connecting the seller with the decision maker helps us get all the information we need to make an informed decision. Have extra information about the debt that you think will help your application? By all means, share it with us.
          %li
            %strong Fast funding.
            Your first approved request will be funded within three days. All subsequent requests will be funded within one day. That’s among the fastest turnaround times in the industry. Get the cash you need quickly so you can get back to the business of running your business.
