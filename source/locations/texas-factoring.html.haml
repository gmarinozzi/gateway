        %h2 Fast & Reliable Factoring for Texas Companies
        %p The quality of the factoring service affects your company's reputation, funding accessibility and financial bottom line. Getting the proper factoring company which will work with you as a “partner” is vital for your business success and growth. If you would like to work with a factoring partner who focuses on customer service, then you should consider working with Gateway Commercial Finance.
        %p After a factoring company buys your accounts receivable it needs to take the necessary steps to ensure the reception of payment when it’s due. This process involves contacting your customers on your behalf to verify that the product or service is satisfactorily delivered and the invoice will be paid on time. Unlike collection agencies, we take a soft approach and seek minimal interaction with account debtors.

          %h3 This Texan company was referred to us by their bank…
          %p Technology Talent is a profitable 9 year old IT staffing company providing consulting services to Fortune 500 and Government agencies. Since its inception, it has relied on the retained earnings and capital from family to support its cash flow needs. Early in 2014 Technology Talent was presented with an incredible opportunity.
          %p <strong>&quot;We have a diversified and impressive customer base. One of our larger IT consulting customers approached us on a time sensitive and complicated project. Almost overnight we had to begin recruiting and hiring highly specialized and expensive consultants to our payroll and to make matters more difficult, this customer requires net 60 day terms. We simply did not have the working capital to support almost a 30 percent increase in our payroll demands.</strong>&quot; Technology Talent has a strong balance sheet, retained earnings and excellent guarantors; however the principals are not U.S. Residents
          %p &quot;We approached several banks with our dilemma and none were in a position to help us given my immigration status. Thankfully, one of the lenders we spoke with encouraged us to contact Gateway Commercial Finance.<strong>&quot; Gateway was able to act quickly and provide Technology Talent with an adequate line to support its increased payroll demands. &quot;It was a stressful time for us and from our initial phone call thru the first funding Gateway made the process easy to understand and straightforward.&quot; </strong>

        %h3 FAQ
        %p <strong>Do you provide recourse or non recourse factoring?</strong>
        %p Gateway Commercial Finance is well known as one of the best factoring companies in Florida. Large and small business owners can depend on us to be upfront about our fees, our advance rate, or any additional cost associated with our financial products. While many factoring service providers typically offer “non recourse” solutions, this usually comes with significant costs, including high premiums and mandatory credit insurance. In order to offer low fees and minimums, while maintaining transparency and avoiding murky contracts, we exclusively offer recourse factoring.
        %p <strong>Do you offer both selective factoring and receivables funding products?</strong>
        %p Yes, we offer both products on a case by case basis.
        %p <strong>Do you offer account receivables financing?</strong>
        %p No, accounts receivables financing is a financial agreement in which a factor holds receivables as assets for collateral. We just buy your account receivables, a simple approach which allows both parties more financial control over the transaction.
        %p <strong>Is my credit score important?</strong>
        %p While we do consider credit history while reviewing applications, it is only one of the many aspects of your application that we review. Our main priority is the creditworthiness of your customers.
        %p <strong>Is factoring the same as lending?</strong>
        %p No, we are not a lending company. Rather than providing a loan or lines of credit, we as factors buy your account receivables at a discount for a fee. You get immediate working capital and avoid debt without worrying about credit history.
        %p <strong>Do you offer any online resources?</strong>
        %p Yes. On our website we cover a large amount of useful financial information about our company and factoring in general. We’ve also provided an interactive form which collects your business information to assess your qualifications and a calculator to measure your cash flow management. As a client, you will have personal access to online reports generated by our factoring software. Through our online reports, you will receive information regarding your balance or any other information regarding your factoring transactions at no extra charge.
        %p <strong>How quickly can I expect to receive funding for my accounts receivable?</strong>
        %p Once your application is approved and your account is set up, you can normally expect 24 hour funding.
        %p <strong>Why should you choose factoring?</strong>
        %p You need money to grow, but don’t want to be at the mercy of sales cycles and unpaid loans. You need quick financing and funds to fuel your growth, but don’t have the luxury to wait a long time to improve your credit.
